      Sisyphus, a cunning king condemned to the eternal repetition of a
      meaningless task, embodies the philosophical dilemma of human existence.
      Doomed to endlessly push a heavy boulder up a hill, only for it to roll
      back down, he symbolizes the absurdity of striving for goals that
      ultimately lead to nothing. His plight raises profound questions about the
      nature of labor, the pursuit of meaning, and the cyclical nature of life
      and death. The myth of Sisyphus serves as a poignant reminder of the human
      condition, highlighting the inherent futility of existence and the
      constant struggle against entropy.
